## General info
Second attempt at a portfolio website. I have used a template here, as I wanted to practice looking through, and editing, code that wasn't originally written by me. It also gave me the opportunity to fiddle with Bootstrap and jQuery
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
